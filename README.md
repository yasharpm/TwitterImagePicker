# Twitter ImagePicker
TwitterImagePicker is an image picker activity that is made to be similar to Twitter's image picker.
4 selection modes are defined that support both selecting a single image and multiple images.
An independent utility class is also included which provides full access over underlying system gallery called `GalleryAccess`. You can use it to create your own image picker.
